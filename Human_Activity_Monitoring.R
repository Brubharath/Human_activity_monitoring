#Question 1
#Load dataset. Load each of the files you captured in Part 1 as a data frame, 
#use computational methods to achieve this. Use names that are meaningful and
#consistent (e.g., subj1_act1). You should have created 12 data frames at the end of
#this task. (6 points)


#In this task we use 2 for loops as we have two conditions to satisfy
#first is the number of the activity and then the number of the subject
#The code picks up the pattern to make the file name and is assigned to a variable.
#then we use the file name to extract the file/data.
#Assign function is assigning the value to the function so that it read the csv file.

#Question 2
#Using computational methods, find the data markers which determine the actual
#data (human activity) needed for this assignment. Obtain the indexes for the start
#and end markers. (8 points)

#First we make an empty in which we are going to store our start and end indexes

#We use the same for loop used in the previous question.

    varname <- paste0("Sub",subject_no,"_act", activity_no)  
    
    #we use get function to convert our string to the actual file. So that it can extract the data off the file.
    df <- get(varname)

    #function to retrive the data where we can find the string "sample"

    #using the string which we created in the last function. So we use the get function.
    df1 <- get(varname)
    
    #We use this flag variable, as we are not able to access the data inside the file directly as the
    #filename keeps changing whenever this loop runs. so we have mentioned the file as varname.
    #This function accessess the file inside the list.
    marker_indexes <- marker_indexes_list[[varname]]

    #this makes us understand which is our clean data

#Question 4
#Name Variables. Once you have stored your data into data frames and identified the
#data markers, name each of your variables. Using computational methods (e.g., a for loop), 
#name each variable using the data marker. You should have named each of the variables 
#from each data frame. (8 points)

#Question 5
#Remove Specific Data. For this assignment we only need the columns containing the 
#number of samples and gyroscopeâ€™s data (gX,gY,gz). Thus, maintain only the gyroscope data 
#and drop the undesired data. At the end, each data frame should have four columns only. (3 points)

#If so, remove the whole row that contains an empty cell or a NA; if not deeded, 
#inform that within your code using comments. (4 points)

#character/symbol within the observations using computational methods. (3 points)

    #are corrected to the desired data type.

    #In this case, since we have a lot of files that we are accessing. We use lapply function to
    #convert all our columns to numeric data type.
    #NOTE: this will give only NA values by coercion if the CSV file is not UTF 8 encoded.

#Question 14
#Using the collected data and your analysis, do you see any difference between 
#the activities? Explain your observations. Add your observations in the code 
#and not in a separated file. 

#In this data we have 12 CSV files which we have used. There were 3 subjects, who performed 4 activities each.
#The activities are listed as follows.
#Sitting
#Standing
#Typing
#walking

#in this project we mainly focus on data capture and preparation. Since the data has already been captured, we
#focus on the preparation part.
.
#In this data we have used markers to differentiate our data from the rest activity to the actual activity,
#our first task is to remove the data which is not useful to us and to remove these markers as well.
#This data consists of 8 columns, containing gyroscopic data, counts/observations, temperature etc
#For this project we need only the gyroscopic data with the number of observations.

#We are supposed to make a lot of plot for our data and also this data needs computing, so the basic thing that
#we do is remove blank data and NA values so that it becomes easy for computation

#We do deal with signal calibration well. In a simple manner, this could mean that it is technique
#depending on type of sensor or the nature that we use in. It's just adjusting the sensor signals to reomve
#errors or bias in the data.
#In this case we remove the offset from the gyroscopic data. 

#When we look at our plots, especially in the beginning where we saw the differences in 
#fluctuation in activities we noticed. Usually Activity 1 and 3 had pretty much the same results 
#as the subject had very less body movement.
#Activity 4 is where most of the activity is noticed when the subject is walking. These 
#show us a higher fluctuation in the gyroscopic data.
#It is important to note that all of these observations which we look at are based off visualization
#and they have to be interpreted cautiously.


#when it comes to these boxplots, the mean values are comparatively low for standing and sitting for gX
#and they are low for gZ as well. Only for gY they are relatively higher when it comes to standing and sitting.

#Understanding the data in question 11, where we tried to remove data according to seconds, can also be tried
#in a different manner with different combinations. As we have collected our data mostly based on observations,
#We can try other combinations to take out maybe even 15% of the data as a rest period to see how our mean and
#standard deviation is affected by it and how much of a difference it makes to our visualizations.
